    "Here we analyze all 75 FBS 1.4 opSims in light of the distribution of time separations, which is already an existing metric [https://sims-maf.lsst.io/_modules/lsst/sims/maf/metrics/tgaps.html#TgapsMetric](https://sims-maf.lsst.io/_modules/lsst/sims/maf/metrics/tgaps.html#TgapsMetric).  However, in this case, we look at the distribution in *log* space.  Specifically from 30s to 10 years (converted to days).  The reasoning being that characterization of AGN structure functions (or PSDs) may benefit from a relatively uniform distribution in $log \\Delta t$ space.  Rolling cadences may benefit AGNs (enabling more short time-separation observations), but extreme rolling cadences would be very bad (leaving few or no long time-separation observations).  For further discussion see the [relevant whitepaper](https://docushare.lsstcorp.org/docushare/dsweb/Get/Document-30572/richards_agn_rolling_wfd.pdf). "
